# Project Sandy
Multi-Platform [AutoSplit](https://github.com/Toufool/Auto-Split) Images Renamer
This program requires PyQt6, optional: install QDarkTheme to use a dark theme

Tested under Python 3.10

# Usage
Before using this make sure:
- Non-dummy splits are in the same order as your splits from LiveSplit
- Dummy splits have ``dummy`` in the filename

After everything's ready:
- Open the split file (only used to get the split names)
- Open the AutoSplit images directory
- Set the global similarity (you'll need to adjust manually for now)
- Set the global pause time (you'll need to adjust manually for now)
- Click on "Rename Images" and you're done!

# Features
- Renames your AutoSplit images
- Automatically add the mask ``{m}`` tag if the current image has transparency
